# servers making up the ZooKeeper ensemble. When the server starts up, it determines which
# server it is by looking for the file myid in the data directory.
# That file contains the server number, in ASCII, and it should match x in server.x in the left hand side of this setting.
# The list of servers that make up ZooKeeper servers that is used by the clients must match the list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper server has.

# There are two port numbers nnnnn. The first followers use to connect to the leader,
